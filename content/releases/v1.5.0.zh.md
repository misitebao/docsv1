A *huge* thank you to the following people for this release:

  * [Travis McLane](https://github.com/tmclane)
  * [Reuben Thomas-Davis](https://github.com/Rested)
  * [Jarek](https://github.com/Jarek-SRT)
  * [Konez2k](https://github.com/konez2k)

## Features

  * Cross-Compilation Support! We now support building binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows on the same machine! Use the `-x` flag to specify which platform to target. It also supports the `-p` (package) flag, allowing you to build natively packaged apps for the target OS. A **HUGE** thank you to [Konez2k](https://github.com/konez2k) for the initial PR and [Travis McLane](https://github.com/tmclane) for the hard work in fixing it up to support all the platform combinations! 
  **Note: This feature requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).**

  * New `-verbose` flag for `wails build` and `wails serve`. This will provide a lot more output for what is happening under the hood.

## New Distribution Support 

  * OpenSuse Tumbleweed + Leap - Thanks [Jarek](https://github.com/Jarek-SRT)!

## Bug Fixes

  * The bridging code (for `wails serve`) has been updated to prevent multiple Goroutine writes. The connection limit has also been increased to 100 - Thanks [Travis McLane](https://github.com/tmclane)!

  * Fixed a RunCommandArray bug where if exec.LookPath returns an error, program is an empty string in the log - Thanks [Reuben Thomas-Davis](https://github.com/Rested)!

## Updates

  * The package dependencies for the default templates have been updated.
