## Features

  * The big new feature is [Sync Stores](https://blog.wails.app/posts/syncstores) - a solution for state synchronisation between JS and Go. The JS runtime package `@wailsapp/runtime` has been updated to support stores. Thanks to [jasonfran](https://github.com/Jasonfran) for input on this also.

  * New Template: Finally we are supporting the awesome Svelte (un)framework! Huge thanks to [Tim Kipp](https://github.com/timkippdev) for this contribution! Tim has also updated the React template!

  * `wails build` now supports custom `ldflags`. Use `wails build -ldflags` to pass them to the compiler.

## New Distribution Support 

  * [Ctlos](https://ctlos.github.io/) is now supported. Thanks to [Dmitry Gomzyakov](https://github.com/kyoto44) for this.
